# lab-04

In this lab, we will learn to write user stories for a Y.com application, similar to Twitter. User stories are brief descriptions of a feature from the user's perspective. They are useful for understanding users' needs and expectations and guiding software development.

## Instructions

Y is a social media platform that allows users to post and communicate through short messages called "Yweets". In this lab, we will create user stories describing the functionalities that a user might desire in this application.

### Requirements
To write effective user stories, we need to consider the following aspects:

- Having a profile where I can configure my user.
- Creating "Yweets" with a maximum of 255 characters.
- Being able to view "Yweets" from other users and interact with them (comment, like, tag other users).
- "Yweets" should be able to accept links, photos, etc.
- Searching tweets through hashtags and also viewing the most used hashtags of the day.

## Submission

You must deliver all the necessary user stories to meet all the features that the Y.com application must have. You must understand that there are explicit and implicit requirements.

User stories must comply with the format "As a [user], I want [functionality], So that [goal]". They should be as precise as possible, and each one should fulfill a user functionality.


## User Story

You must complete this field with all necessary user stories:

1. As an Admin, I want each user to have the ability to create an account by selecting a username and a password, So that the users can access their account and create a profile.
2. As a User, I want to create an acoount just using a mail, So that the creation of an account is easier.
3. As a User, I want my profile page to be customizable (name, description, photo, etc...), So that I can diferenciate my own page with other users.
4. As a User, I want to follow other users, So that I can see what the followed users posts on their profile.
5. As an Admin, I want to add the functionality to users to post a short body of text on their profile, So that users can talk about topics they are interested in.
6. As a User, I want to be able to post not only text but images, videos or links, So that I can show pictures or videos that I like. 
7. As a User, I want Yweets to be able to connect to other Yweets, So that I can continue talking about the same topic that I mentioned on a past Yweet.
8. As a User, I want the functionallity to block other users, So that I don't see Yweets of an especific user.
9. As a User, I want to be able to share my profile with other users, So that my friends can see my profile and Yweets.
10. As a User, I want to download images or videos of other people's Yweets, So that I can save images or videos I like.
11. As a User, I want to be able to interact with Yweets by liking, comenting or saving, So that I can give my opinion about other Yweets
12. As an Admin, I want a central page that shows the user Yweets of the users they follow or suggested Yweets, So that the Users will always see Yweets and make the page less boring.
13. As a User, I want the main page to show the most trending topics the users are Yweeting on Y, So that I can be in touch with the latest news within Y.
14. As a User, I want to attach Yweets with hashtags, So that I can categorize my Yweets with a certain topic.
15. As a User, I want the page to reccomend me wich hashtags to use on my Yweets, So that my posts reach more people.


There is no maximum limit of user stories. They will be evaluated based on meeting the given requirements and the completeness of your stories
